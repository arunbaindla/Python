Q1. There are a total number of Monkeys sitting on the branches of a huge Tree. As travelers 
offer Bananas and Peanuts, the Monkeys jump down the Tree. If every Monkey can eat k 
Bananas and j Peanuts. If Total m number of Bananas and p number of Peanuts offered by 
Travelers, calculate how many Monkeys remain on the Tree after some of them jumped down 
to eat.  
At a time, one Monkey gets down and finishes eating and goes to the other side of the road. 
The Monkey who climbed down does not climb up again after eating until the other Monkeys 
finish eating. Monkeys can either eat k Bananas or j Peanuts. If for the last Monkey there are 
less than k Bananas left on the ground or less than j Peanuts left on the ground, only that 
Monkey can eat Bananas (<k) along with the Peanuts (<j).  
Write the code to take inputs as n, m, p, k, j and return the number of Monkeys left on the 
Tree.  
Where, n = Total number of Monkeys  
k = Number of eatable  Bananas by a single Monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get 
less than k Bananas)  
j = Number of eatable Peanuts by a single Monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get less 
than Bananas)  
m = Total number of Bananas 
p = Total number of Peanuts  
Remember that the Monkeys always eat Bananas and Peanuts, so there is no possibility of k 
and j having a value zero.  
Example 1:  
Input Values 
20 
2 
3 
12 
12 
 
Output Values  
Number of Monkeys left on the Tree: 10

------------------------------------------------------------------------

n=int(input("no of monkeys"))
k=int(input("enter no bananas one monkey can eat "))
j=int(input("eatable peanuts"))
m=int(input("total bananas "))
p=int(input("total peanuts"))
mks_down=0
for x in range(n):
    if(m>=k):
        mks_down+=1
        m-=k
    elif(p>=j):
        mks_down+=1
        p-=j
    elif(m>0 or p>0):
        m=0
        p=0
        mks_down+=1
        break

print("no of monkeys on tree is : ",n-mks_down)
